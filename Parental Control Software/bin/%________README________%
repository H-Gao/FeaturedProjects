REQUIRES ADMIN RIGHTS AND THE CLIENT TO WORK PROPERLY.
> Client should be uploaded soon, along with the wrapper, giving you admin rights ^_^

Without the client:
- You cannot create/view blocked IP addresses.
- You cannot add blocked applications.
- Your "spy mode" and blocked applications will be direct towards YOURSELF.
- Client settings won't load.
